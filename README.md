# React_Memory_Game
User is shown 12 pictures of various fruits, with order of pictures shuffling each time the user clicks on one. If user is able to click on each individual picture with no repeats, then they win. The game is designed to test and build memory skills.

This game is built using the React JS library, with 3 primary components - the title bar, the wrapper containing the image cards, and the image cards. The fruit cards are generated dynamically using a JSON file mapped to the react component for the image cards, and the array is modified as the game progresses.
